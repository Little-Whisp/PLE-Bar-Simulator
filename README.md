# Bar Simulator

I'm working a project for school where I'm going to create a short virtual experience where you play as a bartender and engage in interactions based on how you judge the appearance of avatars. Your task is to serve drinks to avatars based on specific prompts, like "Serve a drink to someone who looks friendly", While you collect points for doing your tasks correctly. At the end of the experience, you’ll get insight into your decisions and how your interactions compare to those of other players.That’s how I want to gain insight into biases and perception in virtual environments. 

Most of the code I did is in path: Assets/VRTemplateAssets/Scripts
